Obstacles:

One of the obstacles I faced during this project is the transition in Java language to C++, since there are minute changes in things such println and cout. I remedied this by using the notes during discussion as well as using the internet to search up certain identifiers. I also struggled a bit to remember logical OR and AND operators, which led to me getting logic errors during the calculation of the boolean and the fine. This took me a lot of trial and error in order to get the correct results. Lastly, I struggled to calculate the fine without redundant code. I overcame this by separating each step beyond the initial with if statements, starting with the amount above 250 and ending with the first 40 thousand.

Test Data:

1. You must enter a defendant name.("")	
	Tests if code gives correct error message after inputting empty string for name, then stops

2. The amount paid must not be negative.("Bob","-1")	
	Tests if code gives correct error message after inputting a negative amount, then stops

3. You must enter y or n.("Bob","1","nein")	
	Tests if code gives correct error message after inputting a string that is not "y" or "n", then stops

4. The suggested fine for Bob is $49.9 thousand.("Bob","75","n")	
	Tests if code calculates correctly if under 250 and greater than 40, while athlete credentials are not fake

5. The suggested fine for Bob is $59.6 thousand.("Bob","75","y")	
	Tests if code calculates correctly if amount is under 250 and greater than 40, while athlete credentials are fake

6. The suggested fine for Bob is $46.4 thousand.("Bob","75","n")
	Tests if code calculates correctly if amount is 40 or less

7. The suggested fine for Bob is $46.4 thousand.("Bob","75","y")
	Tests if code calculates correctly if amount is 40 or less and that athlete credentials don't affect if 40 or under

8. The suggested fine for Bob is $97.5 thousand.("Bob","285","y")
	Tests if code calculates correctly if amount is over 250
